/**
 * Created by napster on 02.05.17.
 * <p>
 * Implement this in all entities to retrieve them easily over a shared function
 * in DatabaseWrapper while having some type safety
 * <p>
 * Works best for entities where we have a natural id for (for example entities on a guild or channel scope cause we can use their snowflakeIds)
 * IEntities should have a constructor that sets them up with sensible defaults
